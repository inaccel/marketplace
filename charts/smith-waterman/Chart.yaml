description: The Smith-Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that is, for determining similar regions between two strings (Target, Query) of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences. Instead of looking at the entire sequence, the Smith-Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and optimizes the similarity measure.
