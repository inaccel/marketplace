    description: The Smith-Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that
      is, for determining similar regions between two strings (Target, Query) of nucleic
      acid sequences or protein sequences. Instead of looking at the entire sequence,
      the Smith-Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and optimizes
      the similarity measure.
