    description: Gzip (GNU zip) is a compression utility designed to be a replacement
      for "compress". Its main advantages over compress are much better compression
      and freedom from patented algorithms.  The GNU Project uses it as the standard
      compression program for its system.

    description: The Smith-Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that
      is, for determining similar regions between two strings (Target, Query) of nucleic
      acid sequences or protein sequences. Instead of looking at the entire sequence,
      the Smith-Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and optimizes
      the similarity measure.
